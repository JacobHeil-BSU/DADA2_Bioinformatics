# DADA2_Bioinformatics
This module starts from raw amplicon sequencing reads and teaches students to use DADA2 to clean the data, turn it into ASVs, and examine the data with basic community statistics. This module was originally designed for the Boise State University Bioinformatics course (BIOL 446).
